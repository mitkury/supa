# Frontend
This directory is for the frontend code of Supamind. The frontend can run both as a website and a stanalone Tauri app. It connects to the backend either by http/websocket or a thin non-networked bridge.

The main goal of the front is to provide a web-enabled UI and connect to backends (and their workspaces)

The frontend uses SvelteKit and Tauri. SvelteKit for UI and Tauri to wrap it as an app.
