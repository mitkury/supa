# Server
Server allows to run a backend (reference ../back/README.md) as a dedicated http/websocket server. It can run both locally and remotely relative to a front (client).

The main goal of the server is to allow clients to connect to backs (and their workspaces) via internet.

The server uses Deno as a TypeScript runtime.
