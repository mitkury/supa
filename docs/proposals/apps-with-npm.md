# Apps with NPM for Supa

## Overview
This proposal outlines a system for building and distributing apps within Supa using NPM as the distribution mechanism. Each app would consist of both frontend and backend components that run within the Supa environment.

## Architecture

### App Structure
- **Frontend**: JavaScript/TypeScript application rendered in an iframe
- **Backend**: JavaScript/TypeScript code executed in a worker
- **Package**: Distributed as NPM packages with a standardized structure
- **Manifest**: JSON file describing app metadata, capabilities, and requirements

### Runtime Environment
1. **Frontend Execution**
   - Host apps in sandboxed iframes
   - Provide communication channel between app and Supa platform
   - Inject Supa context (theme, user data, etc.)

2. **Backend Execution**
   - Run in Web Workers or Node.js workers depending on deployment
   - Provide access to platform APIs through a controlled interface
   - Manage lifecycle (start, stop, restart)

3. **Data Access**
   - Expose database access through a permission-controlled API
   - Allow apps to store app-specific data
   - Enable sharing data between apps with proper authorization

### App Discovery and Installation
- Leverage NPM registry for distribution
- Implement an app store interface within Supa
- Support versioning and updates through NPM version tags

## Security Considerations
For the proof of concept:
- Basic sandboxing through iframes for frontend
- Limited API access for backend workers
- Simple permission model for data access

Future enhancements:
- Content Security Policy enforcement
- More granular permission model
- Resource usage limits

## Development Experience
- Provide SDK and templates for app development
- Create standardized testing environment
- Support local development and testing within Supa

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Proof of Concept
- Define app package structure and manifest format
- Implement basic iframe sandbox for frontend
- Create simple worker environment for backend
- Develop basic platform APIs

### Phase 2: Developer Experience
- Create developer tools and CLI
- Improve documentation
- Build sample apps

### Phase 3: Production Readiness
- Enhance security features
- Optimize performance
- Implement proper error handling and logging

## Open Questions
- How to handle authentication between apps and the platform?
- What limits should be placed on backend workers?
- How to handle app-to-app communication?
- What database access patterns would be most secure and performant?
