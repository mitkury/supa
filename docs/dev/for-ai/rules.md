# Basics for developers

Facts:
- Supa is a standalone application (MacOS, Windows, Linux; not yet Android or iOS, but will be)
- Written in TypeScript
- Frontend is SvelteKit (Svelte 5)
- Tauri is used to build desktop and mobile apps
- Doesn't have a server (yet), everything is local plus using APIs of services, such as OpenAI
- Tailwind is used for CSS utility classes
- Skeleton is used as a design system and components
- AIWrapper is used to interact with AI models

Structure:
- packages/client/src is the client code (Svelte + Tauri)
- packages/core/src is the core functionality shared with client; in the future will be used by servers (when we create a server)
- docs is dev and product documentation

## Updating deps in npm
Sometimes packages get cached with old versions. In that case remove the cache and `npm run dev` again.
`rm -rf packages/client/.svelte-kit packages/client/build packages/client/node_modules packages/core/node_modules packages/client/.vite packages/client/dist`

If you clear cache like that, then `npm install` from the root dor.

## Icons
Use lucide-svelte icons, like this: 
import { Check } from "lucide-svelte";
and <Check size={14} />

# Git commits
Use imperative mood and include type.
Examples:
feat(auth): add user login
fix(payment): resolve gateway timeout
