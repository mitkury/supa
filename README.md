> ‚ö†Ô∏è I'm very much a work-in-progress. What you see below is the vision rather than something that works right now. [Jump here](#current-state) to read about my current state.

# Open platform for AI apps
I‚Äôm Supacloud, a free and open-source platform for AI-powered apps: assistants, search, augmented voice notes, image generation, copy editing, programming, and more. I don‚Äôt need a server to run; just set me up on your devices and start using me.

## ü§î  Why?
I‚Äôm here to eat SaaS. SaaS locks you in, rarely integrates well with other services, and the company behind it can take it away. SaaS is often too bloated, expensive and not integrated with each other.

I want to do three things:
1.	Make software as cheap as ideas.
2.	Let you own your workflows and the data behind them.
3.	Empower every bit of your work with AI, so it handles the boring stuff while you have fun.

## üçΩÔ∏è  Eat all SaaS?
Not all. Some services are too big and complex. Sometimes they‚Äôre the platforms themselves. Salesforce, Figma, and Notion are safe. There‚Äôs a lot of craft in making a great user experience, and the best SaaS excels at that. Sometimes they absolutely need a lot of complexity and huge teams to support them. What I‚Äôm trying to eat are the low-hanging fruits‚Äîsoftware that is valuable but not hard to reproduce.
Especially now, a lot of software could be a thin wrapper around an AI model that does all the heavy lifting. My goal is to provide a convenient interface for users to access artificial intelligence.

## üß© What apps can your run?
Technically, any apps created with web technology. But I‚Äôm more focused on AI-enabled apps. So, you can have your own ChatGPT, Perplexity, Grammarly, etc‚Äîall in one place and free. Anyone can make these apps. Preferably, they will mostly be created by AI with guidance from their users.

## üöÄ How do I use you?
1. Download me.
2. Create a workspace that is stored on iCloud or Dropbox (you can then connect to it from other devices).
3. Optionally, write in the workspace what your goal is (you can have multiple workspaces, e.g., one for personal life and one for business).
4. Set up an AI provider to access AI capabilities.
5. Start chatting with me‚Äîuse me like ChatGPT.
6. Check out other apps available in the app hub, or even create your own.
7. Create new workspaces for big projects, new companies, etc. Enjoy the SaaS-free world.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è No servers?
Your data can be stored in a shared folder, such as iCloud or Dropbox, and then you can connect your devices to those folders. This way, the apps you use and the data they generate are available only to you. You can also use a server to make syncing faster and enable multiplayer (collaboration).
When it comes to intelligence, there are multiple options. You can either connect me to any of the AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq) or run AI locally on your machines.

## üîí Data?
All data, such as conversations with assistants, is stored on your file system, either fully locally or synced with Dropbox, iCloud, etc. You won‚Äôt be vendor-locked with your data or apps, nor will you be tied to a centralized service. You can choose where to host your data and which AI models to use.

## üõ†Ô∏è Open Source?
The code for everything is available under an MIT license. Anyone can use me for free, audit the code, or even create a spin-off. Open source is key to ensuring the longevity and stability of your workflows.
