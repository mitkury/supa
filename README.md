Supa is like ChatGPT but open source. It allows to use the best AI models from different companies, keeps data private, and doesn't require a subscription.

> ðŸš§ Work in progress towards v1.

## Key Features

### No Subscriptions
Pay as you go, either for API costs from AI providers or the actual compute if you run models yourself.

### Best AI Models
Choose and quickly switch between AI models. Connect Supa to providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, or Groqâ€”or run AI locally.

### Private & Local
Your data stays with you. Store everything on your file system, and optionally sync with Dropbox or iCloud to use Supa across multiple devices.

### Open Source
All the code is under the MIT license. Use Supa for free, modify it, or fork it.

## Vision
Supa is an AI chat app now, but the bet is on creating an open ecosystem for AI-powered apps.
