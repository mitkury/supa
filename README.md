# Open platform for AI apps

I'm Supamind, I'm like ChatGPT but open source and the data you and I share stays with you.

Unlike ChatGPT—I don't have to work only with OpenAI models. I can be set up with any model, including open models. I'm not only chat but a set of apps powered by AI, e.g., search (like Anthropic), voice recording (like Superwhisper), copy-editing (like Grammarly). Anyone can create new apps that work within me. Creating apps for me is like creating websites that live in your private workspace and can access the shared data about you, your needs, projects and AI models you've set up.

In short, I'm being developed because there's a benefit of owning AI that adapts to solving your needs as best as it can because it knows about you and what you do.

### Own your data
Data such as conversations and attached files are stored on your file system, either fully locally or synced with Dropbox, iCloud, etc.  These are just folders with files that you can copy and paste. You won't get vendor-locked with your data, nor will you be tied to the availability or big changes of a centralized service (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI, Meta, etc).
### Use any AI model
You can use any model, whether closed like GPT-4 by OpenAI or Claude by Anthropic, or open-source models like Llama or Mixtral with Groq. You can even run local models with Ollama. It's freeing to plug in any model that suits your needs and have an option to change the model while retaining your data.
### Access free AI Apps
There are free open-source apps running within me. The apps use the same primitives and look and feel native. For example, search similar to Anthropic's, text editing similar to Grammarly, voice recording similar to SpeechPolish, developer agents similar to Devin. The idea here is that you can create workspaces, fill them with data relevant to your life & business and then add AI apps that can be tailored for your particular needs. Apps can be written by you, other people as well as AIs.
### Set me up easily
You don't have to run a server to use me. Just download and install on your computer or phone. If you point me to a synced folder—you can then use me across multiple devices sharing the same workspace.
### I'm cheap and sometimes free
There's no monthly subscription to use me. I am true open source and free. But if you want to use powerful AI models—you will have to set up an account for an AI provider (Anthropic, OpenAI) and pay as you go to them. It's not fixed and usually much cheaper than paying $10-20 a month per AI provider. If you run a local model—it will be absolutely free, just pay for the electricity and your own hardware.
