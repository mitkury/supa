# Front
It's the frontend of Supamind. It can run both as a website and a stanalone Tauri app. It connects to backend either by http/websocket or a thin non-networked bridge.

The main goal of the front is to provide a web-enabled UI and connect to backends (and their workspaces)

The frontend uses SvelteKit and Tauri. SvelteKit for UI and Tauri to wrap it as an app.
