# Code of conduct

No strict rules. It's early, so let's see who contributes and what seems right. We'd like to see people with a positive mindset and curiosity about what can be done with the project for their own projects, companies, or personal lives.

Feel free to post anything as long as it's about Supa - features, bugs, proposals, etc.
